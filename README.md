## How it works

- Captures video from the webcam.

- Uses MediaPipe Hands to detect finger positions.

- Interprets hand gestures as Rock, Paper, or Scissors based on which fingers are up.

- Displays the computer‚Äôs move and determines the winner.

- A thumbs up gesture restarts the game.

## Technologies used

- Python

- OpenCV (for video capture and display)

- MediaPipe (for hand tracking)

- random (for computer move selection)

- time (for timing logic)

## How to run

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/021Antonio/RockPaperScissors)

```Git
git clone https://github.com/021Antonio/RockPaperScissors.git
```

2. Enter the right directory

```Git
cd RockPaperScissors/src
```

3. Create a venv folder

```Python
python -m venv venv
```

4. Install all dependencies

```Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the project

```Python
python rock_paper_scissors_model.py
```

## Instructions

- Show your hand to the camera.

- Make the gesture when the countdown reaches 0.

- See the result.

- Show a thumbs up (üëç) to restart the round.
